# Face Recognition + Emotion Recognition

This application recognizes facial emotions (neutral, happy, sad, surprise, anger). It uses the face-detection-retail-0004 model to detect faces, which are then input into the emotions-recognition-retail-0003 model to estimate emotions. This example demonstrates the use of machine learning models with the OAK library.

## Requirements 
- One OAK device with an RGB sensor and a mono pair - e.g. devices such as OAK-D, OAK-D-Lite, OAK-D-Pro or an OAK-FFC-4P with the appropriate sensors will work.

## Usage 
- Assign one device to the App and launch it, streams will be accessible in "Live View".
