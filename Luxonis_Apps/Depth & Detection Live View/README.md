# Working with Dual Streaming of Detections and Depth

This application shows how to process video streams, perform object and depth detection, and stream both outputs to RobotHub.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv6 model.
- Depth detection and processing.
- Live visualization of the video stream and depth.

## Dependencies

- DepthAI
- RobotHub

## Usage 

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Update the configuration to match your setup if needed.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the detections view and depth view in RobotHub.
