# Working with Events

This application demonstrates how to process video streams, perform object detection, and send image events to RobotHub
when a person is detected in the frame.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
- Event-driven image sending to RobotHub when a person is detected.
- Live visualization of the video stream.

## Dependencies

- DepthAI SDK
- RobotHub

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Update the configuration to match your setup if needed.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the live view and the events triggered on person detection.
