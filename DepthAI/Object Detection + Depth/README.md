## Object Detection + Depth

This App uploads a DepthAI pipeline to each assigned device and streams Object Detection and Depth.

For best behaviour use an OAK device with an IR laser dot projector, such as OAK-D-Pro or its PoE version.

### Requirements 
- OAK-D type device with a color sensor and a monopair, ideally an OAK-D-Pro (-W/-FF/-AF). 

### Usage 
- Assign a device to the App and install it. You can change stream FPS in the Configuration tab. If your device isn't an OAK-D-Pro, you will get errors related to IR dot projector being missing and/or unsupported resolutions.
