# Working with Live View

This application demonstrates how to process video streams and perform object detection.
It then visualizes the results in a live view which can be observed in real-time.

## Requirements

- Luxonis device with an RGB sensor.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
- Live visualization of the detection results.
- Drawing utilities to annotate the live view with detection bounding boxes and custom text/lines.

## Dependencies

- DepthAI SDK
- RobotHub

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Update the configuration to match your setup if needed.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the live view for object detection results.
